## `how it works`

As simple as a classic game of life.
We populate a grid with alive cells and see them living or dying (if there are less than two or more than 3 neighbors). You can pause the process on click or clear the grid.
Beware it has been spiced up with the Great and Terrible Unicorn CSS :) Which turns our Game of Life into a disco party!


### `code to show`

-Basic React syntax
-Styled Components syntax
-How to randomize stuff
-FontAwesome icons
-Flexbox
